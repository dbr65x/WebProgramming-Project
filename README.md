# WebProgramming-Project
These are the PHP files I used to build my very own website with. It was designed to run from GSU's Codd server. 
The GitHub version is missing important parts like the jquery files, foundation files, and the phpMyAdmin files that exist within the server that help run the site properly.
The purpose of this is to show off my work here to give a general idea of the code I wrote, not to be able to copy and paste the entire functioning site.
If you want to see my work in action try this link for the time being:https://codd.cs.gsu.edu/~dbaldwin14/Project/Homepage.php
